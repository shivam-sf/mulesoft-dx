# Run Scan and View Results

## Overview

Executes a scanner configuration to discover services from an external platform, then retrieves the scan results including all discovered services. This is useful for manually triggering scans or reviewing what was found.

**What you'll build:** A complete scan execution with visibility into discovered services ready for publication to Exchange.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. **Existing Scanner Configuration**
  - A scanner configuration already set up (see "Set Up a Scanner" skill)
  - Valid connection credentials that haven't expired
2. **Anypoint Platform Access**
  - Valid authorization token
  - Permission to execute scans in your organization

## Step 1: Execute the Scanner

Trigger the scanner to start discovering services from the configured external platform.

**What you'll need:**

- Your organization ID
- Scanner configuration ID

**Action:** Start the scan execution.

```yaml
api: urn:api:agent-scanner-configuration-service
operationId: executeWorkflowFromConfiguration
inputs:
  organizationId:
    from:
      api: urn:api:access-management
      operation: getOrganizations
      field: $.id
      name: currentOrganization
    description: Your organization's Business Group GUID
  scannerConfigurationId:
    from:
      api: urn:api:agent-scanner-configuration-service
      operation: getScanConfigurations
      field: $.content[*].id
    description: The scanner configuration to execute
outputs: []
```

**What happens next:** The scan starts asynchronously. You'll receive a 202 Accepted response. The scan runs in the background, discovering services from the external platform.

**Common issues:**

- **409 Conflict**: A scan is already running for this configuration. Wait for it to complete.
- **404 Not Found**: Scanner configuration doesn't exist or was deleted
- **503 Service Unavailable**: Scan service is temporarily unavailable

## Step 2: Get Scanner Run History

Check the status of your scan by retrieving the run history.

**What you'll need:**

- Organization ID
- Scanner ID (same as scanner configuration ID)

**Action:** Retrieve the list of scan runs to find your execution.

```yaml
api: urn:api:agent-scanner-configuration-service
operationId: getScannerRunHistory
inputs:
  organizationId:
    from:
      variable: organizationId
    description: Same organization ID as Step 1
  scannerId:
    from:
      variable: scannerConfigurationId
    description: The scanner configuration ID (used as scanner ID)
  page:
    value: "0"
    description: Page number (0-indexed)
  size:
    value: "20"
    description: Number of results per page
outputs:
  - name: scanRunId
    path: $.content[0].id
    description: The most recent scan run ID
  - name: scanStatus
    path: $.content[0].status
    description: Current status (RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED, ABORTED)
  - name: startedAt
    path: $.content[0].startedAt
    description: When the scan started
  - name: endedAt
    path: $.content[0].endedAt
    description: When the scan completed (null if still running)
```

**What happens next:** You receive a paginated list of scan runs sorted by most recent. Check the status field to see if your scan is still RUNNING or has COMPLETED.

**Common issues:**

- **Empty results**: No scans have been run yet for this scanner
- **Status shows FAILED**: Check the scanner configuration's lastRunStatusDetail for error information

## Step 3: View Discovered Services

Once the scan completes, retrieve the list of discovered services (staging assets).

**What you'll need:**

- Scanner ID
- Scan run ID from Step 2

**Action:** Get the staging assets discovered during the scan.

```yaml
api: urn:api:agent-scanner-configuration-service
operationId: getStagingAssetsByScanRunId
inputs:
  scannerId:
    from:
      variable: scannerId
    description: The scanner ID
  scanRunId:
    from:
      variable: scanRunId
    description: The scan run ID from Step 2
  page:
    value: "0"
    description: Page number (0-indexed)
  size:
    value: "0"
    description: Use 0 to get all results without pagination
outputs:
  - name: assetId
    path: $.content[*].assetId
    description: The asset ID in Exchange (if published)
  - name: assetName
    path: $.content[*].name
    description: Name of the discovered service
  - name: stagingStatus
    path: $.content[*].stagingStatus
    description: Status (NEW, EXISTING, PUBLISHED, FAILED)
  - name: operationPerformed
    path: $.content[*].operationPerformed
    description: What action was taken (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, SKIP)
```

**What happens next:** You receive a list of all services discovered during the scan, including their names, descriptions, and publication status.

## Completion Checklist

After completing all steps, verify:

- Scan was triggered (202 Accepted)
- Scan run appears in history with status COMPLETED
- Staging assets list shows discovered services
- Review service details for accuracy before publication

## What You've Built

Your scan execution has produced:

**Scan Run Record**

- Timestamped execution record
- Status tracking (RUNNING -> COMPLETED)
- Summary of discovered services

**Discovered Services**

- List of services from the external platform
- Service metadata (name, description, capabilities)
- Staging status for Exchange publication

## Next Steps

Now that you've seen the discovered services:

1. **Review service details**
  - Check the service payload for each discovered service
2. **Monitor publication**
  - Agents with stagingStatus PUBLISHED are live in Exchange
3. **Handle failures**
  - Review services with stagingStatus FAILED for issues
4. **Schedule regular scans**
  - Configure automatic scheduled scans for continuous discovery

## Tips and Best Practices

### Monitoring Scans

- **Poll status**: For long-running scans, poll getScannerRunHistory every 30-60 seconds
- **Check summary**: The scan run summary field contains counts of discovered/updated/failed services

### Understanding Staging Status

- **NEW**: Service discovered for the first time
- **EXISTING**: Service already known, checked for updates
- **PUBLISHED**: Successfully published to Exchange
- **FAILED**: Publication failed (check summary for details)
- **PENDING_UPDATE**: Service has changes pending publication

## Troubleshooting

### Scan Stuck in RUNNING State

**Symptoms:** Scan status remains RUNNING for an extended period

**Possible causes:**

- Large number of services to discover
- Network issues with external platform
- Processing delays

**Solutions:**

- Wait longer for large environments (can take 10-30 minutes)
- Check external platform connectivity
- Use abort endpoint if scan appears stuck

### No Services Discovered

**Symptoms:** Scan completes but staging assets list is empty

**Possible causes:**

- No services exist in the external platform
- Connection credentials lack read permissions
- Platform-specific filters exclude all services

**Solutions:**

- Verify services exist in the source platform
- Check connection credentials have appropriate permissions
- Review scanner configuration parameters

### Scan Fails Immediately

**Symptoms:** Scan status shows FAILED shortly after starting

**Possible causes:**

- Invalid or expired credentials
- External platform API unavailable
- Configuration error

**Solutions:**

- Test the connection using the connectivity test endpoint
- Verify external platform is accessible
- Check lastRunStatusDetail on the scanner configuration
